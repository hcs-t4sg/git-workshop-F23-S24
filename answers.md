1. Difference between git and github: Git is a version control system that keeps track of changes made to files or documents. It allows us to view different versions of our code which is especially helpful as we make more changes over time. Github is a cloud hosting system that manages software projects. It is an interactive online platform and integrates with git to make it much more visual.
